# 0x17 - C - Doubly Linked Lists

This directory contains scripts related to doubly linked lists in the C programming language.

## Goals

The primary goal of this directory is to provide examples of how to use doubly linked lists in C programming. The examples provided in this directory should help you understand how to implement doubly linked lists in C programming and how to use them effectively.

## Files

This directory contains the following files:

**lists.h** – This header file contains the definitions and functions for creating and manipulating doubly linked lists in C programming.

**0-print_dlistint.c** – This file contains a function that prints all elements of a doubly linked list.

**1-dlistint_len.c** – This file contains a function that returns the length of a doubly linked list.

**2-add_dnodeint.c** – This file contains a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.

**3-add_dnodeint_end.c** – This file contains a function that adds a new node at the end of a doubly linked list.

**4-free_dlistint.c** – This file contains a function that frees a doubly linked list.

**5-get_dnodeint.c** – This file contains a function that returns the nth node of a doubly linked list.

**6-sum_dlistint.c** – This file contains a function that returns the sum of all data (n) of a doubly linked list.

**7-insert_dnodeint.c** – This file contains a function that inserts a new node at a given position.

**8-delete_dnodeint.c** – This file contains a function that deletes the node at a given index of a doubly linked list.
